# To-Do-App
Created a simple To-Do App which allows you to add tasks to a list. You can then click on the task and it will get greyed out with a line through it. If you finish all your tasks, you can click a button which will delete all of them off your list. The app was built using Express.js, Node.js, pg-promise & Handlebars.js

When you land on the main page, you will see your tasks displayed. If there are no tasks displayed, simply click "Click here to add a task".

Once you add a task, you will be redirected to the main page and your tasks will be displayed.

When you finish a task, you can click on it which will draw a line in the middle and grey the task out. When you have finished all the tasks or want to clear your to-do list, simply click "Click here to delete all tasks" which will clear the list.
